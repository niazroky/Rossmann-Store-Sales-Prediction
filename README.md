# Rossman Store Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Rossman Store Sales Prediction repository! This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the sales of various Rossman stores using Random Forest models. Below is a brief overview of the project and relevant links:

## Overview

This project utilizes historical sales data for Rossman stores to predict future sales. The dataset includes information such as store type, assortment, promotions, and more. By exploring the dataset, engineering features, and building predictive models, we aim to accurately forecast store sales.

## Key Features

- **Dataset:** Historical sales data for Rossman stores, including various features such as store type, assortment, promotions, etc.
- **Target Variable:** Sales figures for each store on a given day.
- **Exploratory Data Anylysis:** Matplotlib and Searborn are used to interpret the data. 
- **Modeling Techniques:** Random Forest models are employed to predict store sales.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like root mean square error (RMSE) and root mean square percentage error (RMSPE).
- **Feature Importances** Find what are the features that affects most.
